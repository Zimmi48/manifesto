project_description: "This project contains Hoare Type Theory libraries from
[How to make ad hoc proof automation less ad hoc](https://software.imdea.org/~aleks/papers/lessadhoc/journal.pdf) paper.
\n\n
The project presents a series of design patterns for *canonical structure* programming that
enable one to carefully and predictably coax Coqâ€™s type inference engine into triggering
the execution of user-supplied algorithms during unification, and illustrates these patterns
through several realistic examples drawn from Hoare Type Theory.
The project also contains a typeclasses-based re-implementation for comparison."
