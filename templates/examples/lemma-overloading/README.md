This project contains Hoare Type Theory libraries from
[How to make ad hoc proof automation less ad hoc][paper] paper.

The project presents a series of design patterns for *canonical structure*
programming that enable one to carefully and predictably coax Coqâ€™s type
inference engine into triggering the execution of user-supplied algorithms
during unification, and illustrates these patterns through several realistic
examples drawn from Hoare Type Theory. The project also contains a
typeclasses-based re-implementation for comparison.

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version is via
[OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-lemma-overloading
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/coq-community/lemma-overloading
cd lemma-overloading
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
make install
```

After installation, the included modules are available under
the `LemmaOverloading` namespace.
