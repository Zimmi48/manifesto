  This project contains Hoare Type Theory libraries from
  [How to make ad hoc proof automation less ad hoc][paper] paper.

  The project presents a series of design patterns for *canonical structure*
  programming that enable one to carefully and predictably coax Coqâ€™s type
  inference engine into triggering the execution of user-supplied algorithms
  during unification, and illustrates these patterns through several realistic
  examples drawn from Hoare Type Theory. The project also contains a
  typeclasses-based re-implementation for comparison.
